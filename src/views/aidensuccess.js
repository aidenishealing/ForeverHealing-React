          obstacles were a part of your nature, upbringing, or DNA, I&apos;m

          I tried everything I could find to uncover why my digestive system was
          going haywire, why my heart rate randomly spiked, why brainfog clouded
          my focus, and why I constantly felt fatigued and in pain.

          Physical therapy, counselors, meditation, articles online, traditional

          I was frustrated that despite looking at many solutions, they were
          only temporary and made me consider giving up. It was not until I
          uncovered the link between hidden emotional baggage and how it
          directly controls your digestion, can strain your heart, and
          energetically clog your brain that...

          When I found a permanent solution, in the matter of months I
          experienced permanent healing. Insulin Resistance? Gone. Joint Pain?
          Gone. Digestive Problems? Gone. Overthinking? Vanished. Tired after
          eating or sleeping? No More.
