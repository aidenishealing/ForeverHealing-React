            &quot;Over a year ago I was in the hospital for over 6 months after
            a brain surgery at 82 years old due to a blood clot that had not
            been discovered from decades ago. I was told I would not live five
            more years by my doctors, lost weight, and always needed to rest.

            For most of my life I played sports, woke up early for meditation
            and yoga, and tried to be active. But I still had lots of pain and
            had to rest throughout the day.

            But after the first few sessions I knew without a doubt this was
            something special. I was reenergized, relaxed, and felt a noticable
            difference with pain, tension, and stiffness throughout my body.

            Aiden created a program for regaining the strength I thought was
            forever lost due to my age. Everyone told me that because of age we
            got certain problems, but, I know that is not the case!

            It was impossible for me to be skeptical when I felt pain in my feet
            reduce, years of knee pain reduce, and even a toothache that was
            bothering me vanish days after a session. I had no clue that all
            those years of stress was affecting my body so much.

            I even had weakness and numbness in my legs for over 5 years which
            was healed in under 6 months.

            My strength was coming back, I was able to feel my feet and legs
            again, let go of all the outdated information that was harming my
            health, and feel amazing. Now we are working on healing my shortness
            of breath and asthma.
